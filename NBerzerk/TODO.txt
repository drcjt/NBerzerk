* Look into backing up sourceforge as described here:

	http://software.ac.uk/resources/guides/creating-and-managing-sourceforge-projects

* Use GameObjects like here:

	http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/180069-xna-2d-bounding-box-collision-detection/

  for everything - this should then allow collision detection without actually having a proper pixel buffer.

* Unit testing?

* Create custom font (ttf) and use DirectWrite to draw text. See example in SharpDX:

	https://code.google.com/p/sharpdx/source/browse/Samples/DirectWrite/?r=7df82ec58c8b7706300f3dd1e5f6b5a4c2ffd335#DirectWrite%2FCustomFont

  hmm - maybe need to use spritefont instead, see here:

   https://code.google.com/p/sharpdx/source/browse/Samples/Toolkit/SpriteBatchAndFont/SpriteBatchAndFontGame.cs?r=0bbba8530ce07845d296653d675c597adc08e70a

  See here for bitmap font format:

   http://directxtk.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=MakeSpriteFont&referringTitle=SpriteFont

  I think I need to redo font.png into this format

* Learn what the heck WIC is in directX.

* Is there going to be a lot of changes when next release of SharpDX is released, e.g. DrawingPoint class is renamed as Point etc...

* Need to work out how input works in DX

* Need to work out how to do pixel based collision detection

* Is it possible to write unit tests for directx code?? See here for possible option:

		Drawing north from pillar includes starting pillar & ending pillar
		Drawing south from pillar includes starting pillar & ending pillar
		Drawing east from pillar does not include starting pillar
		Drawing west from pillar includes starting pillar & ending pillar
