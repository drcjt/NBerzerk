When player collides with wall in first original room (251, 123) then player restarts
in room with maze walls like (NNWE,NE?W), this appears to be room (??, 179). Going left
from this room leads to a room with maze walls (NWNW,SENE) which appears to be room (??, 178).
There are 64 possibilities for these rooms!!


* Look into backing up sourceforge as described here:

	http://software.ac.uk/resources/guides/creating-and-managing-sourceforge-projects

* Use GameObjects like here:

	http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/180069-xna-2d-bounding-box-collision-detection/

  for everything - this should then allow collision detection without actually having a proper pixel buffer.

* Unit testing?

* Create custom font (ttf) and use DirectWrite to draw text. See example in SharpDX:

	https://code.google.com/p/sharpdx/source/browse/Samples/DirectWrite/?r=7df82ec58c8b7706300f3dd1e5f6b5a4c2ffd335#DirectWrite%2FCustomFont

  hmm - maybe need to use spritefont instead, see here:

   https://code.google.com/p/sharpdx/source/browse/Samples/Toolkit/SpriteBatchAndFont/SpriteBatchAndFontGame.cs?r=0bbba8530ce07845d296653d675c597adc08e70a

  See here for bitmap font format:

   http://directxtk.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=MakeSpriteFont&referringTitle=SpriteFont

  I think I need to redo font.png into this format

* Learn what the heck WIC is in directX.

* Is there going to be a lot of changes when next release of SharpDX is released, e.g. DrawingPoint class is renamed as Point etc...

* Need to work out how input works in DX

* Need to work out how to do pixel based collision detection

* Is it possible to write unit tests for directx code?? See here for possible option:

* Room dimensions:

	Top left wall:		(4, 0) - (103, 3)

	Bottom left wall:	(4, 204) - (103, 207)
	Bottom right wall:	(152, 204) - (251, 207)

	Left top wall:		(4, 0) - (7, 71)
	Left bottom wall:	(4, 136) - (7, 207)
	Right top wall:		(248, 0) - (251, 71)
	Right bottom wall:	(248, 136) - (251, 107)

	Pillars:

		Top row (left to right)
	
			Pillar 1:		(56, 68) - (59, 71)
			Pillar 2:		(104, 68) - (107, 71)
			Pillar 3:		(152, 68) - (155, 71)
			Pillar 4:		(200, 68) - (203, 71)

		Bottom row (left to right)

			Pillar 7:		(152, 136) - (155, 139)
			Pillar 8:		(200, 136) - (203, 139)

		Drawing north from pillar includes starting pillar & ending pillar
		Drawing south from pillar includes starting pillar & ending pillar
		Drawing east from pillar does not include starting pillar
		Drawing west from pillar includes starting pillar & ending pillar
