0. Look into using SharpDX.Toolkit's high level game API - is this only for 3d or will it work for 2d too? Note this is not cross platform.

1. Create custom font (ttf) and use DirectWrite to draw text. See example in SharpDX:

	https://code.google.com/p/sharpdx/source/browse/Samples/DirectWrite/?r=7df82ec58c8b7706300f3dd1e5f6b5a4c2ffd335#DirectWrite%2FCustomFont

   hmm - maybe need to use spritefont instead, see here:

   https://code.google.com/p/sharpdx/source/browse/Samples/Toolkit/SpriteBatchAndFont/SpriteBatchAndFontGame.cs?r=0bbba8530ce07845d296653d675c597adc08e70a

   See here for bitmap font format:

   http://directxtk.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=MakeSpriteFont&referringTitle=SpriteFont

   I think I need to redo font.png into this format

2. Create class for main game objects, e.g. player, room, robots, etc... and refactor existing code into these classes. Classes will need a 
   Render method, maybe an Update method too?? Main game will just delegate to these objects to Render/Update.

3. Learn what the heck WIC is in directX.

4. Is there going to be a lot of changes when next release of SharpDX is released, e.g. DrawingPoint class is renamed as Point etc...

5. Need to work out how input works in DX

6. Need to work out how to do pixel based collision detection

7. Is it possible to write unit tests for directx code?? See here for possible option:

8. Room dimensions:

	Top left wall:		(4, 0) - (103, 3)
	Top right wall:		(152, 0) - (251, 3)
	Bottom left wall:	(4, 204) - (103, 207)
	Bottom right wall:	(152, 204) - (251, 207)

	Left top wall:		(4, 0) - (7, 71)
	Left bottom wall:	(4, 136) - (7, 207)
	Right top wall:		(248, 0) - (251, 71)
	Right bottom wall:	(248, 136) - (251, 107)

	Pillars:

		Top row (left to right)
	
			Pillar 1:		(56, 68) - (59, 71)
			Pillar 2:		(104, 68) - (107, 71)
			Pillar 3:		(152, 68) - (155, 71)
			Pillar 4:		(200, 68) - (203, 71)

		Bottom row (left to right)

			Pillar 5:		(56, 136) - (59, 139)
			Pillar 6:		(104, 136) - (107, 139)
			Pillar 7:		(152, 136) - (155, 139)
			Pillar 8:		(200, 136) - (203, 139)

		Drawing north from pillar includes starting pillar & ending pillar
		Drawing south from pillar includes starting pillar & ending pillar
		Drawing east from pillar does not include starting pillar
		Drawing west from pillar includes starting pillar & ending pillar
